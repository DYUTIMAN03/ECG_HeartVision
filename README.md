# ECG Heartbeat Classification Using VGG16

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture to classify ECG heartbeat signals into Normal and Abnormal categories.

## 📚 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset
- **Model:** Fine-tuned VGG16
- **Goal:** Classify ECG heartbeats from 1D signal images.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. Preprocessing ECG signals
2. Converting 1D signals to 2D images
3. Building and fine-tuning the VGG16 model
4. Training and Validation
5. Model Evaluation and Metrics

## 🖼️ Sample Results

(sample images or graphs will be added here later!)
